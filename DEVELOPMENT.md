# Development workflow

Develop only from this Git clone. Do not edit the Syncthing copy under
`MyAddons`: it is a deployment handoff, never a Git worktree.

Run the repository tests first. Then make a runtime-only staging folder, using
the one TOC intended for that client:

```sh
python3 tools/stage_addon.py --toc Speedster.toc --addon-name Speedster --output /mnt/backup/syncthing/kevin/myaddons/_staging
```

For the provisional Camelot preview, substitute `Speedster_Camelot.toc` once
it has been brought into this clone. Syncthing delivers `_staging/Speedster`
to the Windows PC; from there, use the explicit installer/copy step for the
intended WoW client and `/reload`. Confirm the loaded version in-game. Do not
tag, push, or publish local builds.
